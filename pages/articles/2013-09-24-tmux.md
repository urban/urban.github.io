I recently came across several [getting started][1] articles on [tmux][2] and decided to augment my existing workflow to take advantage of it. After getting over the initial hurdle of learning the [tmux specific commands][3], things have been great. Below is a brief overview of what `tmux` is, how to use it and also highlight some of it's&nbsp;features.

## Sessions

`tmux` is a terminal multiplexer, meaning it allows you to run multiple virtual terminal sessions. Sessions are completely separate work environments. I create different named sessions for each project I'm working on. This is useful because as long as you don't re-boot your computer, you can _detach_ from the session and _attach_ to the session at will while preserved context: _working directories_, _command history_ and&nbsp;_processes_.

## Windows

Each session can have multiple windows that provide a tabbing interface. With them you can quickly move switch windows using keyboard shortcuts similar to how you `Alt+Tab` between OS&nbsp;windows.

{% gist 6232602 windows %}

## Panes

Panes allow you to split your _windows_ into multiple _panes_ both vertically and horizontally. This is great for viewing multiple command line utilities or scripts in development without hiding them behind tabs or making them background&nbsp;processes.

{% gist 6232602 panes %}

## Configuration

Out of the box `tmux` has sane defaults however you can customize it with your own configuration file. Below is my `~/.tmux.conf`&nbsp;file.

{% gist 6232602 .tmux.conf %}

{% gist 6232602 .tmux.keys %}

## Workflow

I often work on several different client and personal projects throughout the day. By naming both my `tmux` sessions and windows, I'm able to switch between them quickly and get back to right where I left off with my preserved command history in each pane. In addition, I usually split my windows into 2-3 panes so I have visibility of the `stdout` and `stderr` streams from my development tools. This gives me visibility into what's happening vs. hiding them with background processes or terminal&nbsp;tabs.

## Conclusion

Adding `tmux` to my development workflow has been a great improvement over what I was doing, making me more productive. Hopefully you'll find it as useful as I&nbsp;have.
