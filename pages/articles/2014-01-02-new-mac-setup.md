I recently got a new 15" MacBook Pro with Retina display and thought I'd document my setup for posterity. Below I'll list all the applications and utilities I have installed as well as my OS configurations.

## Applications

## Operating System

I honestly don't customize my OS as much as other people do. I just move the doc to the left, remove everything from it and make it auto-hide. Other than that I use spotlight as an application launcher.
