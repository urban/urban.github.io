I worked as a Graphic Designer and was responsible for leading the design and UI development of the corporate website, one subsidiary website, the digital annual reports, custom widgets for the intranet and interactive presentations for the Executive Team. I also designed print material such as the quarterly magazine, business to business and other marketing materials.
