As a Senior Developer I was responsible for delivering high quality, cutting edge interactive UI experiences for our clients. I worked closely with design to develop solutions using Flash, Silverlight and JavaScript/HTML/CSS for various .com startups and Fortune 500's like Microsoft, HouseValues, Cingular, AT&T, Best Buy and Netflix.
