- Led the modernization of Oracle’s JET frontend platform, defining and executing a multi year architecture roadmap used across OCI, Fusion Apps and GBU teams serving thousands of customers.
- Drove a major VDOM migration of core UI primitives to address long standing performance and maintainability constraints, enabling more predictable rendering behavior and unblocking downstream teams building complex, modern applications.
- Designed and introduced platform level abstractions for theming, layout, and component composition, reducing fragmentation and improving reuse and consistency across teams.
- Established standardized frontend quality gates in CI, including accessibility, performance, and visual regression testing, significantly reducing regressions and increasing release confidence across product teams.
- Led a sustained effort to eliminate accessibility debt by integrating automated testing, shared patterns, and clear ownership models, reducing the backlog by more than 85% and raising baseline accessibility compliance across the platform.
- Acted as the technical bridge between design, product, and engineering by translating UX requirements into scalable platform capabilities, aligning stakeholders through RFCs, architecture reviews, and shared decision making.
- Introduced clear ownership and operating models, including DRI and RACI, to reduce decision latency and ambiguity in cross org initiatives, enabling more predictable delivery.
- Remained hands-on in critical areas of the codebase, contributing to architecture, reviews, and key implementations while mentoring senior engineers.
