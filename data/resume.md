I am a developer and designer with more than 15+ years of experience creating digital products and services. I thrive in a collaborative environment where development and design are deeply integrated. I enjoy using systematic design thinking that enable teams to create multiple products simultaneously. Combined with particular development methodologies and practices, I can help teams maintain velocity in the face of changing requirements.
