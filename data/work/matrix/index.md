MileZero is building a Software as a Service in the transportation and logistics industry. The software focuses on the "middle mile" and "last mile" segments and will coordinate same day services such as delivery, pickup, install and etc.

I was hired by MileZero as Head of Design to design and develop an application for Network and Fleet managers to use that gave them visibility into there workforce as they execute tasks.

In a quick research phase, I gathered user requirements and features from my stakeholders and prioritized a list of capabilities for the application. I then established UX & Design principles, a UX model and began wire-framing the application. With the help of a contract visual designer, I art directed a few iterations of design until we landed on something that fit my vision.

After the design phase, I developed a real-time mock server that uses JSON API REST endpoints to develop and test the UI against. I also developed the web application and a component Library using Webpack 2, React, Redux, React Router Redux, Redux-Saga, Reselect, Ramda and CSS Modules.
