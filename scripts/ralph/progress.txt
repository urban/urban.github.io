- 2026-02-27: Completed build-graph Slice 1 (issue #9): created packages/build-graph CLI with from/to validation and deterministic blank graph-snapshot.json write, added tests, and passed bun run typecheck + bun run test. Attempted to comment on GitHub issue #9 but network access to api.github.com is blocked in this environment.
- 2026-02-27: Completed build-graph Slice 2 (issue #10): added backup-on-overwrite in the CLI by copying existing `to/graph-snapshot.json` to `to/graph-snapshot.json.bak` before writing a new snapshot; added CLI test coverage for backup behavior; exported backup filename constant from package entrypoint; passed `TURBO_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/turbo-cache bun run typecheck` and `TURBO_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/turbo-cache bun run test`. Attempted to comment on GitHub issue #10 but network access to api.github.com is blocked in this environment.
- 2026-02-27: Completed build-graph Slice 3 (issue #11): added `packages/build-graph/src/core/discover.ts` with recursive Markdown discovery for `.md` files, stable normalized relative-path output, and deterministic lexicographic sorting; wired discovery into `runBuildGraph` orchestration before snapshot write; exported discovery API from `packages/build-graph/src/index.ts`; added `packages/build-graph/test/discover.test.ts` to verify recursive discovery and stable ordering. Passed `TURBO_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/turbo-cache bun run typecheck` and `TURBO_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/turbo-cache bun run test`. Attempted to comment on GitHub issue #11 but network access to api.github.com is blocked in this environment.
- 2026-02-27: Completed build-graph Slice 4 (issue #12): added schema-first frontmatter validation before assembly by introducing `packages/build-graph/src/domain/schema.ts` and `packages/build-graph/src/core/validate.ts`; implemented aggregate frontmatter diagnostics across all discovered Markdown files; normalized YAML date scalars to ISO date-only strings for strict validation; wired validation into `runBuildGraph` before snapshot writes; exported validation/domain APIs in `packages/build-graph/src/index.ts`; added `packages/build-graph/test/validate.test.ts` and CLI coverage for invalid frontmatter hard-failure before write. Passed `bun run typecheck` and `bun run test`. Attempted to comment on GitHub issue #12 but network access to api.github.com is blocked in this environment.
- 2026-02-27: Completed build-graph Slice 5 (issue #13): added duplicate permalink hard-failure diagnostics in `packages/build-graph/src/core/validate.ts` via `BuildGraphDuplicatePermalinkError` with grouped permalink-to-file-path reporting; enforced duplicate-permalink failure before snapshot writes; exported duplicate diagnostics/error from `packages/build-graph/src/index.ts`; added duplicate permalink coverage in `packages/build-graph/test/validate.test.ts` and `packages/build-graph/test/cli.test.ts`. Passed `bun run typecheck` and `bun run test`. Attempted to comment on GitHub issue #13 but network access to api.github.com is blocked in this environment.
- 2026-02-27: Completed build-graph Slice 6 (issue #14): added `packages/build-graph/src/core/parse.ts` with strict v1 wikilink parsing for `[[target]]` and `[[target|display]]`, including embed exclusion for `![[...]]`, whitespace normalization, and malformed-sequence filtering; exported parser APIs from `packages/build-graph/src/index.ts`; wired parser invocation into `runBuildGraph` for link parsing/counting; added parser coverage in `packages/build-graph/test/parse.test.ts` for supported syntax, ordering/normalization, and unsupported/malformed sequences. Passed `bun run typecheck` and `bun run test`. Attempted to comment on GitHub issue #14 but network access to api.github.com is blocked in this environment.
- 2026-02-27: Completed build-graph Slice 7 (issue #15): added `packages/build-graph/src/core/resolve.ts` with case-insensitive resolver v1 indexing and path-then-filename matching, including deterministic candidate ordering; exported resolver APIs from `packages/build-graph/src/index.ts`; wired resolver usage into `runBuildGraph` to resolve parsed wikilinks with v1 semantics and log resolved counts; added `packages/build-graph/test/resolve.test.ts` covering precedence, filename fallback, deterministic ambiguous candidate ordering, and unresolved targets. Passed `bun run typecheck` and `bun run test`. Attempted to comment on GitHub issue #15 but network access to api.github.com is blocked in this environment.
- 2026-02-27: Completed build-graph Slice 8 (issue #16): added resolver alias support by indexing frontmatter aliases case-insensitively in `packages/build-graph/src/core/resolve.ts`; enforced strict precedence order `path -> filename -> alias`; preserved deterministic candidate ordering for ambiguous alias matches; expanded `packages/build-graph/test/resolve.test.ts` with alias fallback, strict precedence, and ambiguous-alias coverage; updated CLI resolver log messaging in `packages/build-graph/src/cli/main.ts` to include alias matching. Passed `bun run typecheck` and `bun run test`. Attempted to comment on GitHub issue #16 but network access to api.github.com is blocked in this environment.
- 2026-02-27: Completed build-graph Slice 9 (issue #17): added `BuildGraphAmbiguousWikilinkResolutionError` and typed ambiguity diagnostics in `packages/build-graph/src/core/resolve.ts`, plus `summarizeWikilinkResolutionsV1` to deterministically count uniquely resolved links and surface ambiguous per-link candidate paths; wired hard-failure ambiguity handling into `packages/build-graph/src/cli/main.ts` so ambiguous wikilinks fail before snapshot writes; exported new resolver APIs from `packages/build-graph/src/index.ts`; expanded tests in `packages/build-graph/test/resolve.test.ts` and `packages/build-graph/test/cli.test.ts` for ambiguity diagnostics and CLI failure behavior. Passed `TURBO_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/turbo-cache bun run typecheck` and `TURBO_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/turbo-cache bun run test`. Attempted to comment on GitHub issue #17 but network access to api.github.com is blocked in this environment.
- 2026-02-27: Completed build-graph Slice 10 (issue #18): added `packages/build-graph/src/core/build.ts` to assemble a directed graph snapshot with note nodes, unresolved-link placeholder node creation/reuse (normalized-target keyed), link edges, and non-hard unresolved diagnostics; wired snapshot generation into `packages/build-graph/src/cli/main.ts` and exported new build/snapshot APIs from `packages/build-graph/src/index.ts`; added `packages/build-graph/test/build.test.ts` for placeholder creation/reuse behavior and expanded `packages/build-graph/test/cli.test.ts` to validate placeholder/diagnostic snapshot output. Passed `bun run typecheck` and `bun run test`. Attempted to comment on GitHub issue #18 but network access to api.github.com is blocked in this environment.
