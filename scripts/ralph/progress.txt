# Ralph Auto Progress Log
# This file tracks autonomous task completions

- 2026-02-27: Completed build-graph Slice 1 (issue #9): created packages/build-graph CLI with from/to validation and deterministic blank graph-snapshot.json write, added tests, and passed bun run typecheck + bun run test. Attempted to comment on GitHub issue #9 but network access to api.github.com is blocked in this environment.
- 2026-02-27: Completed build-graph Slice 2 (issue #10): added backup-on-overwrite in the CLI by copying existing `to/graph-snapshot.json` to `to/graph-snapshot.json.bak` before writing a new snapshot; added CLI test coverage for backup behavior; exported backup filename constant from package entrypoint; passed `TURBO_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/turbo-cache bun run typecheck` and `TURBO_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/turbo-cache bun run test`. Attempted to comment on GitHub issue #10 but network access to api.github.com is blocked in this environment.
- 2026-02-27: Completed build-graph Slice 3 (issue #11): added `packages/build-graph/src/core/discover.ts` with recursive Markdown discovery for `.md` files, stable normalized relative-path output, and deterministic lexicographic sorting; wired discovery into `runBuildGraph` orchestration before snapshot write; exported discovery API from `packages/build-graph/src/index.ts`; added `packages/build-graph/test/discover.test.ts` to verify recursive discovery and stable ordering. Passed `TURBO_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/turbo-cache bun run typecheck` and `TURBO_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/turbo-cache bun run test`. Attempted to comment on GitHub issue #11 but network access to api.github.com is blocked in this environment.
